Motor control experiment on STM8 Discovery board

This is the directory for the BLDC motor control stm8 (Discovery board) implementation.

Some use has been made of the ST Peripheral control library. 
It is possible that we would evaluate t STMicroelectronics STM8Sxxx 
three-phase BLDC motor control software library (UM0708).
