  *  The way it's described in Toshiba AN, as if the PWMd leg turns off,

  *  Does IR2104 dead-time account for this ?:
  *
  * Second: assert /SD ==OFF  of (only!) the PWMd FET - to ensure that flyback

                ... the channel that is floating (about to be PWM) will "echo" 
                    the comm. switch pulse, so FIRST (after stop PWM) set the driving channels to GND
if a phase is floating up from low-drive, when the lower-switch turn off it flyback clamp to HV
 When the PWM on the upper-arm turn-off, the flyback is to clamp to GND so this is ideal discharge of flaoting coil.
 
 If a phase is floating down from high-pwm, when the upper-switch turn off the flyback is to GND by the lower body diode.
 Ideally the lower-arm is then PWMd and when the low-side switch off the flback of upper body diode is to HV. 
 This does not keep the previous state, so the direction of the float transition is not known.
 The flyback discharge of this 1100kv motor seems to need ~50uS holdoff before
 restarting the PWM, otherwise the back-EMF may get squashed until the higher speed is reached.
 THere would not seem to be enough energy in the small motor to worrry about trying 
 to coordinate the flyback discharge with the oncoming (next-leg) PWM.
